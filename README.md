# POKEAPI
This is my simple pokeapi project. In this project I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a hint of Bootstrap 5. This project is responsive on different screen sizes.

## How it works

- On the top of the screen the user is welcomed by a simple header with text.
- Under that you have a search bar that can look up any pokemon in the pokeapi database
- Upon searching for a pokemon, a card will pop up under the search with the searched for pokemon's image, name, type(s), abilities and base stats.
- You can add as many cards as you would like
- You can also delete cards as you create them
